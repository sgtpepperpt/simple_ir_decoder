Arduino code for a simple converter from IR pulses to a binary code.

This assumes a NEC-like protocol used by Whirlpool A/Cs, with the standard pulses plus a "separator" command.

It's based on the code by [Brian Schwind](http://blog.bschwind.com/2016/05/29/sending-infrared-commands-from-a-raspberry-pi-without-lirc/).
